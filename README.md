Regenerative healing is a rare phenomenon in adult mammals, with reindeer antlers serving as one of the most well-studied models of complete tissue regeneration. Unlike most tissues, which heal through fibrotic repair and scar formation, reindeer antlers regenerate fully, restoring both structure and function without scarring. In this study, I investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regenerative healing of reindeer antlers by comparing gene expression profiles in antler velvet (regenerating tissue) and dorsal skin (fibrotic repair) across four time points: Day 0, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14 post-injury \cite{sinha2022fibroblast}.

The transcriptomic dataset was generated by the Biernaskie Lab at the University of Calgary, Department of Comparative Biology and Experimental Medicine, and comprises bulk RNA-seq data from wounded and control tissues of antler velvet and dorsal skin \cite{geo2022gse168746}. The dataset includes 34 samples collected from 4 individual reindeer, spanning four post-injury timepoints (Day 0, 3, 7, and 14), with both tissue types represented at each timepoint. I performed a time-course bulk RNA-seq analysis, utilizing DESeq2 for differential gene expression analysis. Protein sequences for the significantly regulated genes were retrieved from Ensembl BioMart, followed by functional annotation using InterProScan \cite{ebi_interpro}. Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched and categorized into regenerative, fibrotic, or other biological processes to distinguish the pathways activated in these two distinct tissue healing modes.

My results show that antler velvet tissue activates a unique combination of regeneration-related genes, including those involved in keratin production, ion channel activity, and neural signaling at Day 14, a time point critical for tissue functional restoration. These findings suggest that neuronal regeneration, epithelial growth, and vascular remodeling are key components of the regenerative process. In contrast, dorsal skin healing is characterized by persistent expression of fibrosis-related genes, such as collagen crosslinking and extracellular matrix production, which are associated with scar formation and tissue stiffening. Inflammatory signaling remains prominent throughout the skin healing process, with little to no activation of regeneration-related pathways. The analysis pipeline and findings are accessible in this GitHub repository.
